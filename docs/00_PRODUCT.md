# Product — university-exam MBBS companion

MEDCAIN (“Drug of Choice for Exam Pain”) is an **India-focused MBBS university-exam** app: previous-year theory
questions (PYQs), textbook page citations, optional sample answers, topic
reference links, and MCQ practice.

It is **not** a NEET-PG mock-test product. The timed sectional engine still
exists in the codebase for MCQ practice sessions only. Mini / Subject / Mock /
Grand catalog tests are **retired** from the student-facing IA (not merely
hidden). Practice sessions still create `tests` / `attempts` rows internally.

## Universities

Students pick their **state**, then **affiliating university** at onboarding
(university list is filtered to that state) and can change the same fields
on Profile (state, university, college, MBBS year, batch).

**v1 content bank** is **Kerala University of Health Sciences (KUHS)** —
code `KUHS`. Other universities are listed so the picker is real. If that
university has no tagged papers yet, PYQ lists for it stay empty until sheet
rows are added. Adding another university later is new sheet rows, not a
schema rewrite.

Curriculum (year → subject → topic → lesson) is **shared** across universities
and is how we **tag** questions for revision. PYQs are
**university-owned** via `exam_papers.university_id` → appearances. A real
university paper mixes many topics in one sitting — see
`docs/10_INDIA_MBBS_EXAMS.md`.

## Content hierarchy

- **Exam unit (what the student sits):** university + subject + year + paper
  (Paper I / Paper II / …) → questions in that paper, several chapters.
- **Syllabus tags (shared):** Year (MBBS phase) → Subject → Topic → Lesson.
  A lesson is a syllabus unit, not a PYQ count. Used to group questions.
- **Question kinds** on a lesson or paper: theory PYQ and/or MCQ.

## Question kinds

| Kind | What it is | Player |
|---|---|---|
| `pyq_theory` | University / internal written stem (essay / short note / VSA by marks) | PYQ reader — not scored |
| `mcq` | Four-option recall item | PYQ reader **DA** / **EX**, **or** the existing tutor/exam practice player |

## Sample answers and reference links

- **Direct answer (DA)** is `sample_answer_text` for theory or MCQ. The PYQ
  reader opens with **DA** already expanded (tap again to collapse).
  Pro-gated (separate table). Missing content shows “No direct answer yet”
  — never invent text in the client. MCQ DA also shows the correct option.
- **Explanation (EX)** is `explanation_text` plus textbook citations and
  “More on this topic” links, for either kind. Collapsed until **EX**. Do not
  put the MCQ key on teasers.
- **Textbook refs** are citations (book + edition + page). Never store PDFs.
- **Lesson resources** are https “read more” links. `is_free` links are
  visible without Pro.

## UX direction

Visual language is MEDCAIN’s blue-on-black brand (black canvas, cyan/blue
CTAs, cooler indigo chrome, gold Pro chips) while keeping **Docci**. Theme is **System / Light / Dark**, persisted, **Light default**.

Home is a PYQ dashboard (coverage banner, year + university, subject cards).
Opening a subject starts with **exam years**, then that year’s paper outline
(LAQ / Short notes / MCQ tabs). Chapter and Paper I/II live in Filters.
Topic → lesson is for grouping, not the first tap.

## Monetization

Signup grants **Pro for 4 days**, then effective plan falls back to `free`
via existing `current_plan()`. Free users keep a teaser slice
(`required_plan = 'free'`). Paid plans stay on the **website Razorpay
checkout**, not Play/App Store IAP.

## Out of v1

In-app notes / charts / viva / drug cards, offline packs, campus-ambassador
CRM, phone OTP, Internship/PG stages, group-discount checkout, NEET-PG mode
